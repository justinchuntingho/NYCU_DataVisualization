## Course Schedule

This course is designed to teach basic Python programming, data wrangling, data visualization, and eventually building an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. Below I have listed the reading materials. Most of the readings are taken from [Computational Analysis of Communication](https://cssbook.net/), an open access book.
