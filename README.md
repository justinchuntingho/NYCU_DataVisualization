# Data Visualization

Materials for the Data Visualization course offered by the Department of Communication and Technology, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.

Maintainer: Justin Chun-ting Ho


## Course Schedule

This course is designed to teach basic Python programming, data wrangling, data visualization, and eventually building an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. Below I have listed the reading materials. Most of the readings are taken from [Computational Analysis of Communication](https://cssbook.net/), an open access book. For additional reference, I recommend following the free Python for Everybody course offered by Dr. Charles R. Severance (available as both [website](https://www.py4e.com/html3/) and [video](https://www.py4e.com/lessons)).
